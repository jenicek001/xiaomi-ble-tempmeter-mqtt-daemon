## Publication Breakdown

### By Type
- **Threshold-Based**: 26 publishes (96.3%)
  - Temperature triggers: 19
  - Humidity triggers: 7
- **Periodic**: 1 publish (3.7%)
  - 5-minute interval respected

### By Device
- **Loznice**: 15 publishes (most active due to humidity event)
- **DetskyPokoj**: 6 publishes (gradual temperature changes)
- **Obyvak**: 6 publishes (5 threshold + 1 periodic)

## Notable Test Events

### 🌡️ Real-World Humidity Spike Captured
**Time**: 21:43:47 - 21:44:25 (38 seconds)  
**Device**: Loznice (Bedroom)  
**Event**: Humidity jumped from 50.3% → 80.6% → 50.0%

**System Response**:
- ✅ Detected 12.9% initial jump immediately
- ✅ Published 8 updates in 38 seconds
- ✅ Tracked recovery to normal levels
- ✅ All threshold breaches logged with exact delta values

**Likely Cause**: Door opened/closed or person movement in room

**Conclusion**: System proved its value by capturing real environmental changes in real-time!

## Friendly Name Feature Validation

### ✅ All Tests Passed

1. **Configuration Loading**
   - 3/3 devices loaded with friendly names
   - Czech UTF-8 characters (Loznice, Obývák, Dětský pokoj) working perfectly

2. **Log Integration**
   - Every log message includes friendly name for easy identification
   - Example: `Publishing sensor data for 4C:65:A8:DC:84:01 (immediate) (Loznice)`

3. **MQTT Messages**
   - All 27 published messages include `"friendly_name"` field
   - JSON properly formatted with UTF-8 encoding
   - Retained messages verified via mosquitto_sub

4. **Message Type Field**
   - `"threshold-based"` correctly set for 26 immediate publishes
   - `"periodic"` correctly set for 1 interval-based publish
