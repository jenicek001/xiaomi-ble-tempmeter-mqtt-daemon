# Step 2 Implementation: Core BLE Communication

## ‚úÖ What's Implemented

The Bluetooth Manager has been successfully implemented with the following features:

### Core Functionality

- **Device Discovery**: Scan for Xiaomi Mijia thermometers via BLE
- **Data Reading**: Connect to devices and read sensor data
- **Data Parsing**: Parse MiBeacon advertisement data format
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic and timeout management
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and connection handling

### Key Components

#### `BluetoothManager` Class

- Async/await BLE communication using `bleak` library
- Support for both LYWSD03MMC and LYWSDCGQ/01ZM devices
- Configurable retry attempts and timeouts
- Device discovery with duplicate filtering

#### `SensorData` Class

- Structured data container for sensor readings
- Temperature, humidity, battery percentage, and timestamp
- JSON conversion for MQTT publishing
- Battery percentage from MiBeacon protocol

#### Features Ported from Original

- BLE characteristic handles (0x0038 for notifications, 0x0046 for config)
- Device-specific configuration for LYWSD03MMC
- Direct battery percentage from MiBeacon advertisements
- MiBeacon protocol parsing for temperature, humidity, and battery

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests

Comprehensive test suite covering:

- Device discovery with mocked BLE scanner
- Data reading with simulated notifications  
- Data parsing with various test cases
- Error handling and timeout scenarios
- Battery calculation edge cases

### Manual Testing

Run the test script:

```bash
python test_bluetooth.py
```

**Requirements for testing:**

- Linux system with Bluetooth adapter
- Root/sudo privileges for BLE access
- Xiaomi devices powered on and nearby

## üìä Data Flow

```dataflow
1. Device Discovery
   BleakScanner ‚Üí Filter by name ‚Üí Device list

2. Data Reading  
   BleakClient ‚Üí Enable notifications ‚Üí Parse data ‚Üí SensorData

3. Data Format (5 bytes)
   [temp_low][temp_high][humidity][volt_low][volt_high]
```

## üîÑ Integration Points

The BluetoothManager is ready to integrate with:

- **Step 3**: MQTT Publisher (publishes `SensorData.to_dict()`)
- **Step 4**: Configuration Manager (uses config dict)
- **Step 5**: Device Manager (manages device registry)

## üöÄ Usage Example

```python
from src.bluetooth_manager import BluetoothManager
from src.constants import DEFAULT_CONFIG

# Initialize
bt_manager = BluetoothManager(DEFAULT_CONFIG["bluetooth"])

# Discover devices
devices = await bt_manager.discover_devices()

# Read data
for device in devices:
    data = await bt_manager.read_device_data(device["mac"], device["mode"])
    if data:
        print(f"Temperature: {data.temperature}¬∞C")
        print(f"JSON: {data.to_dict()}")
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **Linux Only**: BLE functionality requires Linux Bluetooth stack
2. **Permissions**: Needs root privileges or proper user groups
3. **Device Support**: Only LYWSD03MMC and LYWSDCGQ/01ZM tested
4. **Connection Limit**: One connection at a time per device

## üéØ Next Steps

Ready to proceed with:

- **Step 3**: MQTT Publisher implementation
- **Step 4**: Configuration management with Pydantic
- **Step 5**: Main daemon orchestration
