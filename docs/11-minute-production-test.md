## Test Results Summary

### ✅ Device Discovery
- All 3 devices discovered within 10 seconds
- Friendly names correctly associated
- RSSI values captured (-75 to -82 dBm)

### ✅ Initial Data Publication
- **Loznice**: First complete data at 21:42:59 (32s after startup)
- **DetskyPokoj**: First complete data at 21:43:02 (35s after startup)
- **Obyvak**: First complete data at 21:44:20 (1m 53s after startup)

All devices published with `message_type: "threshold-based"` on first complete reading.

### ✅ Threshold-Based Publishing

#### Temperature Threshold (0.2°C) Triggers
Total: **19 threshold-based publishes** triggered by temperature changes

Examples:
- 21:43:42 - DetskyPokoj: 0.3°C change (22.3→22.6°C)
- 21:44:03 - Loznice: 0.3°C change (22.5→22.8°C)
- 21:45:45 - DetskyPokoj: 0.3°C change (22.6→22.9°C)
- 21:49:51 - DetskyPokoj: 0.2°C change (22.9→23.1°C)
- Multiple 0.2°C changes detected and published correctly

#### Humidity Threshold (1.0%) Triggers
Total: **15 threshold-based publishes** triggered by humidity changes

Notable events:
- **21:43:47** - Loznice: **12.9%** jump (50.3→63.2%) - Large spike detected!
- **21:43:51** - Loznice: **14.1%** jump (63.2→77.3%) - Continued spike
- **21:43:53** - Loznice: 3.3% change (77.3→80.6%) - Spike continuing
- 21:44:03 - Loznice: 20.5% drop (80.6→60.1%) - Recovery
- 21:44:05 - Loznice: 2.4% change (60.1→57.7%)
- Multiple 1.0-1.6% changes detected properly

**Analysis**: The large humidity spike (50→80%) in Loznice was likely caused by someone entering the room or briefly opening a door/window. The system correctly detected and published these rapid changes immediately.

### ✅ Periodic Publishing (5-minute interval)

Only **1 periodic publish** occurred during the 11-minute test:
- **21:49:20** - Obyvak: `message_type: "periodic"` (5m 00s after first publish at 21:44:20)

This is correct behavior - periodic publishing only triggers when:
1. 5 minutes have elapsed since last publish
2. Device has not already published via threshold triggers

The other two devices (Loznice, DetskyPokoj) had frequent threshold-based updates, so no periodic publishes were needed.

## Publishing Statistics

### Total Publications by Device (11 minutes)

| Device | Total Publishes | Threshold-Based | Periodic | Avg Interval |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|
| **Loznice** | 15 | 15 | 0 | 44s |
| **DetskyPokoj** | 6 | 6 | 0 | 110s |
| **Obyvak** | 6 | 5 | 1 | 110s |
| **Total** | **27** | **26** | **1** | - |

### Publishing Rate
- **Average**: 2.45 publishes/minute across all devices
- **Peak activity**: 21:43:47 - 21:44:25 (8 publishes in 38 seconds from Loznice)

## Friendly Name Integration

### ✅ Configuration Loading
All friendly names loaded correctly:
```
21:42:37,019 - src.sensor_cache - INFO - Discovered new LYWSDCGQ device: 4C:65:A8:DC:84:01 (Loznice)
21:42:37,019 - src.sensor_cache - INFO - Discovered new LYWSDCGQ device: 4C:65:A8:DB:99:44 (Obyvak)
