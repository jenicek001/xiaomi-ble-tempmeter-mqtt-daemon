# Pull Request Merge Comment

## Summary

This PR represents a major milestone in improving the project's maintainability, usability, and documentation. It addresses three critical areas: repository organization, timezone handling, and user onboarding experience.

## üéØ Key Achievements

### 1. Repository Structure Cleanup ‚ú®
The repository was cluttered with 50+ files in the root directory, making it difficult to navigate and understand the project structure. This PR reorganizes everything into a clear, logical hierarchy:

- **Before**: 42+ Python scripts mixed in root (experiments, tests, debugging tools all together)
- **After**: Clean root with only 13 essential files, everything categorized in `experiments/`, `tests/`, and `docs/`

This makes it significantly easier for new contributors to understand the codebase and find relevant files.

### 2. Timezone Bug Fix üïê
Fixed a critical issue where all MQTT message timestamps were showing UTC time instead of the user's local timezone. This was particularly confusing for users in different timezones trying to correlate sensor events with local time.

- **Impact**: All users now see correct local timestamps in Home Assistant and MQTT messages
- **Implementation**: Added `TZ` environment variable support with sensible defaults
- **Validation**: Thoroughly tested on Raspberry Pi in production environment

### 3. Improved User Onboarding üìö
Added comprehensive Docker installation instructions specifically for Raspberry Pi users, who represent the majority of our user base. Previously, users had to search external documentation to get Docker installed before following our Quick Start guide.

## üîç Technical Details

### File Operations Breakdown
- **57 file renames** using `git mv` (preserves full history)
- **8 new documentation files** (README files for each category + planning docs)
- **6 file deletions** (unused code and obsolete docs)
- **5 file modifications** (docker-compose.yml, .env.example, README.md, .gitignore, test config)

### No Breaking Changes
- ‚úÖ All functionality remains intact
- ‚úÖ Docker Compose configuration backward compatible (uses sensible defaults)
- ‚úÖ Existing user configurations continue to work
- ‚úÖ Only addition is optional TZ environment variable

### Testing & Validation
- Tested on Raspberry Pi 5 with actual LYWSD03MMC sensors
- Docker image builds successfully (2-3 minutes on RPi)
- Daemon runs healthy with proper timezone display
- MQTT messages publish correctly with local timestamps
- Home Assistant discovery working as expected

## üìà Impact Assessment

### For Users
- **Easier onboarding**: Step-by-step Docker installation instructions
- **Better experience**: Correct local timestamps in all messages
- **Clearer documentation**: Well-organized docs directory

### For Contributors
- **Easier navigation**: Clear directory structure
- **Better understanding**: Category-specific README files explain purpose of scripts
- **Preserved history**: All git history maintained through file renames

### For Maintainers
- **Reduced confusion**: No more duplicate or scattered test files
- **Better organization**: Easy to find experimental vs production code
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs about project evolution and decisions

## üöÄ Recommendation

**I recommend merging this PR** because:

1. It significantly improves project maintainability without breaking existing functionality
2. The timezone fix addresses a real user pain point
3. Better documentation lowers the barrier to entry for new users
4. All changes are thoroughly tested and validated
5. Git history is fully preserved for all moved files

This PR sets a strong foundation for future development and makes the project more accessible to the community.

## üìù Post-Merge Actions

After merging, consider:
1. Updating any external documentation or wiki pages that reference old file locations
2. Announcing the improved Raspberry Pi installation guide to users
3. Possibly creating a GitHub release to mark this milestone
4. Reviewing and archiving old issues that may have been addressed by the restructuring
